Experian Sees Organic Revenue Growth, to Divest Email Marketing Business

(Reuters) - Experian Plc, the world's biggest credit data company, forecast mid-single digit organic revenue growth at constant currencies on Wednesday, after strong growth in its credit services and decision analytics units boosted first-half profit.

Experian said it had started the process of divesting its email/cross-channel marketing business - the largest part of its marketing services unit - after a strategic review showed "fewer" synergies between the business and the rest of its portfolio.

The FTSE-100 company, which is best known for running consumer credit checks for banks, landlords and retailers, said profit before tax rose 14 percent to $520 million (419 million pounds) in the six months ended Sept 30.

Experian said it had started the year well with organic revenue growth of 5 percent, in line with its target range, as its credit services and decision analytics units performed well and its smaller marketing services unit showed improvement.
