NETS 119, TIMBERWOLVES 110

NEW YORK (AP) — Brook Lopez scored 26 points and Brooklyn kept Minnesota winless on the road.

The Nets shot 55.3 percent from the field and had eight players with at least nine points, a surprisingly easy offensive performance against a young Wolves team that clearly hasn't yet grasped Tom Thibodeau's defensive schemes.

Trevor Booker added 15 points and Sean Kilpatrick had 14 for the Nets.

Andrew Wiggins scored a career-high 36 points for the Wolves, making a career-best six 3-pointers. Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points, but scoring wasn't the problem for Minnesota.

The Wolves are 0-4 on the road and just 1-5 overall.

It was close most of the way, neither team having much luck stopping the other, and the Nets' lead was just two after Wiggins' jumper with 56 seconds left. Bojan Bogdanovic then made a 3-pointer with 37 seconds to go for a 115-110 lead, and Isaiah Whitehead and Bogdanovic closed it out with free throws.

But Conley came up with a steal in the closing seconds and drove the length of the court before the ball was knocked out of bounds by Denver with 0.7 seconds to go.

The Grizzlies went up 83-76 early in the fourth quarter on a twisting layup by Jarell Martin and led by 95-88 following a driving layup by Andrew Harrison midway through the quarter.
